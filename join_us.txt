1, Design and Optimize the SVG Icon
Create an SVG icon and compress it to reduce the file size. Ensure it is under 10 KB.

2, Add Icon to the Public Directory
Place the optimized SVG file in the "public" directory of the project : public/ouline or public/solid


3, Run the Finalization Script
Run the command npm run final or pnpm run final. This will automatically generate two files: icons.json and iconsDetails.json.

4, Add Icon Descriptions
Open iconsDetails.json and add a description for each new icon youâ€™ve added.

5, Push Changes to GitHub
Commit your changes and push them to GitHub.
